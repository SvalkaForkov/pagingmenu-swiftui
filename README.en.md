## Why?

I need this feature in my own project, but there is nothing particularly easy to use on github, so I just wrote it myself

## Get Started

Copy or download to your own project and modify it

## Todo

Low maintainability and expandability. It's full of magic numbers so it may be hard to modify the layout
